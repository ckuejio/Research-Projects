## How to clone this website:
8. Add new photos and whatnot in static/img and new pdfs in static/pdf
9. Change the name on the atom feed in blog.xml and in _includes/header.html
10. Make an account on Disqus and replace _includes/disqus.html with the relevant information there.
11. Set up google analytics and update it in _includes/footer.html, or remove it completely - it is not very useful!
