For the past 16 years, I've researched how the physical environment influences human health and well-being. I am a co-author of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Building Resilience Against Climate Effects (BRACE) Framework. This framework comprised a small portion of the Presidentâ€™s Climate Action Plan (2012). I frequently work with health departments to understand and adapt to climate change.
